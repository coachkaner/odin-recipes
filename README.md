# Introduction

For this project, I built a basic HTML recipe website.

[**Link to the live site can be found here**](https://coachkaner.github.io/odin-recipes/)

## About this project

This project allowed me to practice the HTML knowledge I acquired in the foundations section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).

The website consists of a main index page which links to a few recipes. This website doesn't look very pretty as I just used HTML. No CSS has been applied as I haven't reached that section of the course yet.

### Features

- 5 Webpages (1 homepage & 4 recipe pages).
- Clickable links to navigate between the pages.
- Images of each of the recipes.
- Instructions on each recipe page on how to make each dish.

### Technologies

- HTML

### Tools

- Visual Studio Code Editor
- Git and GitHub
- Git Bash

## Outcome

- Created my recipe website.
- Re-enforced my understanding of basic HTML concepts.
- Used Git/Git Bash Hub to push my edits to the GitHub repository I setup for this project.
- Hosted a live version of my website on GitHub.
