    <h1>Oven Fried Chicken</h1>
    <p>
      I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess. I came
      up with this oven-fried version, and have been making it ever since!
      Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well.

      Cut down on oil by making "fried" chicken in the oven. This oven-fried
      chicken recipe, made with simple ingredients you probably already have on
      hand, is as good as it gets.
