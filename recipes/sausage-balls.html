      These 3-ingredient sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you
      serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat, a party appetizer, a game-day
      nibble, or a holiday hors d'oeuvre. Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit
      mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese team up for savory, cheesy flavor that can't
      be beat. These are so yummy! My family makes every Christmas morning.
